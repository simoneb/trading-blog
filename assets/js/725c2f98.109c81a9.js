I mainly copied others\' investment ideas, or followed hearsay and other not very scientific ways to make investment decisions. \\r\\n\\r\\nThen, in late September 2022 I eventually decided that it was about time I took a step in what is hopefully a better way of doing it. Being a software developer, the approach that felt most natural to me was that of systematic trading.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack then I didn\'t have a clear idea of what that meant. I assumed it involved writing some sort of software program that would do the trading more or less autonomously.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Choosing a training course\\r\\n\\r\\nI never followed any training courses on trading or investment, so I ended up relying on my gut feeling to choose one. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many options out there and I went with [Unger Academy](https://ungeracademy.com/). The main reason is that in their ads and the few [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@UngerAcademy) videos I had watched they seemed to know what they were talking about. Note that I am not promoting nor am I affiliated to them in any way.\\r\\n\\r\\n# What is systematic trading\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first time I heard about systematic trading I was both attracted and scared by the idea of a program running day and night, trading on my behalf. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe thought of writing a program was exciting - after all that\'s what I do for a living - while that of operating complex infrastructure was quite daunting.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://github.com/simoneb/trading-blog/assets/20181/de2499e9-4022-491f-bde6-4395fb0c1017)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSystematic trading basically boils down to:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Coming up with a trading idea to apply on a certain asset\\r\\n2. Writing a program to execute it\\r\\n3. Backtesting it against historical data to validate it\\r\\n4. Using specialized software to run and automate it\\r\\n\\r\\nObviously, this is all easier said than done, and there are great amounts of knowledge that go into each step, and many decisions to be made along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\n# What to expect\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this blog I am going to document and share my journey, along with takeaways, struggles and useful things I create along the way.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you start learning something new it\'s particularly effective to capture it. The beginning is when the most \\"aha!\\" moments will happen, and I have collected quite a few already, which are worth sharing.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there\'s anything that you\'re specifically interested into, post it in the comments below.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Stay tuned!**"}]}')}}]);
